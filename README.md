This project is to predict House Sale Price based on many features.

First I looked upon the distribution of sales price, to see if it is uniformly distributed or not.

Then I used Linear Regression, XGBoost Regressor, Support Vector Regressor, RandomForestRegressor to predict the price. 

I used GridSearch along k-fold cross validation techniques to find the best estimators of individual method.
